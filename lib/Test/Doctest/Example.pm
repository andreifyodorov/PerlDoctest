=head1 Example

=head2 This is only an example.

	>>> 1 + 1
	2

=head2 Checked values are perl expressons.

	>>> 'foo'
	'foo'
	>>> undef
	undef

=head2 They are compared in deep manner.

	>>> [1, 2, 3, {foo => 'bar', bar => 'foo'}]
	[1, 2, 3, {bar => 'foo', foo => 'bar'}]

=head2 Multiline statements are supported.

	>>> 90 / (
	...		4 + 5
	... )
	10

=head2 Result could also be multiline

    >>> [1, 2, 3, {foo => 'bar', bar => 'foo'}]
    [
            1, 2, 3,
            {bar => 'foo', foo => 'bar'}
    ]

=head2 Original Test::Doctest one-line statements are supported too.

	$ 1 + 1
	2

=head2 Variables that were localized inside pod block...

	>>> my $foo = 10
	10

...are local to the end of the block.

	>>> $foo *= 2
	20

=head2 Variables that were localized inside pod block...

...and to the end of consequent blocks with the same name.

	>>> $foo *= 2
	40

=head2 But no longer.

	>>> no strict 'vars'
	>>> $foo
	undef

=head2 Tests are being run in the package namespace, so you can easily call subs.

	>>> foo()
	5

=cut

sub foo {
	return 5;
}
