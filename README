Test-Doctest

Doctest verifies your documentation and your code at the same time.
By executing usage examples in your documenation it validates that your
documentation is up-to-date and that your code is behaving like documented.

The principle comes from the python community. Python's doctest executes
examples in so called docstrings. In perl the usage examples are found in pod.
